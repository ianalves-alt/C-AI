  "recentPrompt": "This project focuses on using loops in C. Create a program that takes an integer as input from the user, representing the number of times to print \"Hello, world!\".  The program should then use a `for` loop to print the message that many times. This improves your understanding of iterative control flow.\n\nTo use this project, declare an integer variable. Use `scanf` to get user input. Then, use a `for` loop to iterate the specified number of times, printing \"Hello, world!\" in each iteration using `printf`.\n\nExample usage:\n\nEnter the number of times to print: 5\nHello, world!\nHello, world!\nHello, world!\nHello, world!\nHello, world!\n"
