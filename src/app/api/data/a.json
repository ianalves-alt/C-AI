  "recentPrompt": "Today's project builds on our previous work with variables and arithmetic. We'll create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle.  This introduces the concept of using multiple variables together to perform a calculation. You'll declare variables for length and width, get their values from the user using `scanf`, calculate the area (length * width), and then display the result using `printf`. This project improves your understanding of variable usage, input/output operations, and applying arithmetic in a more practical context.  Example output: \"Enter length: 5\\nEnter width: 10\\nArea: 50\".\n"
