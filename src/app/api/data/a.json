  "recentPrompt": "Let's create a simple calculator that adds two numbers. Building upon your knowledge of variables, user input, and arithmetic, this project introduces the concept of *floating-point numbers* (or floats). Floats are used to represent numbers with decimal points. In this project, declare two float variables to store the numbers the user inputs. Prompt the user to enter two numbers, read those numbers using `scanf` (remember to use `%f` for floats), add the two float variables, store the result in another float variable, and print the result to the console, using `printf`. This reinforces arithmetic operations and introduces a new numeric datatype, allowing for more precise calculations and handling of numbers with decimals. Example output: \"Enter number 1: 3.14\\nEnter number 2: 2.0\\nSum: 5.14\". You will improve your understanding of variables and how to use different types and `printf`.\n"
