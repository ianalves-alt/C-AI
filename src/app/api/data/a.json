  "recentPrompt": "This project expands on the student record system by adding the ability to search for specific student records.  The program should allow the user to input a student ID and then search the data file (previously created and populated) for a matching ID. If a match is found, the program should display the student's complete record (ID, name, and all grades and weights); otherwise, it should display a \"Student not found\" message. This introduces the concept of linear searching through data stored in a file, reinforcing file input/output and string comparison (comparing the entered ID with IDs in the file).  Error handling should still be implemented for file operations, and the program should gracefully handle cases where the input ID is invalid (e.g., not a number or not found in the file).\n"
